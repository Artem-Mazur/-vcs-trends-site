  <h1>Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>

  <p>
    Version control is not a static field — new practices and integrations have emerged that extend what
    version control systems can do. Today’s trends focus on automation, cloud integration, and
    collaboration. Developers now use Git not just to track source code, but also to manage infrastructure,
    automate deployment, and streamline teamwork. The following list outlines key modern trends shaping
    how version control is used in modern software development.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>GitOps:</strong>  
      An approach that applies version control to operations and infrastructure management. Configuration files (like Kubernetes manifests)
      are stored in Git, and changes are applied automatically through CI/CD tools such as <em>FluxCD</em> or <em>ArgoCD</em>. Git serves as the
      single source of truth for both code and infrastructure, ensuring automation, traceability, and rollback safety.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:</strong>  
      Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment rely on version control as their foundation. Each code commit can trigger
      automated builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring consistent, testable, and rapid releases. Tools like <em>GitHub Actions</em>,
      <em>GitLab CI</em>, and <em>Jenkins</em> integrate directly with Git repositories to streamline this workflow.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cloud-Based Collaboration Platforms:</strong>  
      Services such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, 
      <a href="https://gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, and 
      <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> 
      have transformed how developers collaborate. They combine version control with issue tracking, code review,
      continuous integration, and team management, enabling seamless global teamwork and open-source collaboration.
    </li>
  </ul>
